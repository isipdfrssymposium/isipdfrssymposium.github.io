We extract a sequence \\(\\hat{u}_n\\) such that the image of leaves corresponding to a certain quadratic differential under \\(\\hat{u}_n\\) has bounded geodesic curvature and the bound is independent of \\(n\\). Moreover, if the bound is less than \\(1\\), then there exists a sequence which subconverges to a harmonic map \\(\\hat{u}_\\infty : \\mathbb{C} \\to \\mathbb{H}^3\\) asymptotic to a twisted ideal polygon. # Lecture 2 # Algebraic Aspects and Functoriality of the Set of Affiliated Operators # Speaker: Indrajit Ghosh # Abstract: In their foundational work, Murray and von Neumann studied a specific class of unbounded operators that are, in a precise sense, associated with a given von Neumann algebra. These operators are now referred to as Murray–von Neumann affiliated operators. Their study led to significant structural results concerning the underlying von Neumann algebra. It was later proven that for finite von Neumann algebras, the set of affiliated operators, as defined by Murray and von Neumann, forms a well-structured algebraic object, specifically a topological *-algebra. However, the algebraic structure of affiliated operators in the general case remains mysterious. In this talk, we introduce a new class of unbounded operators associated with a given von Neumann algebra, which we term affiliated operators. We show that for a von Neumann algebra \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), the set of affiliated operators, denoted \\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{aff}}\\), is closed under the operator sum, product, Kaufman inverse, and adjoint operations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that \\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{aff}}\\) has the structure of a (right) near-semiring. Additionally, we prove that the near-semiring \\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{aff}}\\) transforms functorially under normal *-homomorphisms, establishing it as an intrinsic construction of \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). As a key result, we show that this new notion of affiliation encompasses the classical Murray–von Neumann affiliation. By leveraging the functoriality of \\(\\mathcal{M}_{\\mathrm{aff}}\\), we also demonstrate that the set of Murray–von Neumann affiliated operators is intrinsic to \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), thus independent of any specific representation. # Lecture 3 # Paired, inner-paired and Toeplitz + Hankel operators # Speaker: Soma Das # Abstract: The idea of paired operators can be traced back at least to Widom\u0026rsquo;s 1960s work in the context of singular integral equations. In this talk, we will discuss paired operators on the Hilbert space \\(L^2(\\mathbb{T})\\) of all Lebesgue square-integrable functions on the unit circle \\(\\mathbb{T}\\). Toeplitz and Hankel operators have different facades and flavors, but the classification problem of paired operators on \\(L^2(\\mathbb{T})\\) prompted us to investigate Toeplitz + Hankel operators on the Hardy space, and they have also been classified. We will also introduce the notion of inner-paired operators defined on the classical model spaces and discuss its classification. This talk is based on a joint work with Nilanjan Das and Jaydeb Sarkar. # Lecture 4 # Lefschetz Algebras on Smooth Projective Varieties # Speaker: Bhishek Garg # Abstract: I will introduce the Lefschetz algebra \\(L^*(X)\\) on a smooth complex projective variety \\(X\\) and construct an example which does not satisfy the analogues of Hard Lefschetz and Poincaré Duality. To do this I will introduce Grassmannians and flag varieties. The contents of this talk are mostly from the paper by June Huh and Botong Wang – Lefschetz Classes on Projective Varieties. # Lecture 5 # Liftings and Invariant Subspaces of Hankel Operators # Speaker: Sneha B # Abstract: We prove a Hankel-variant commutant lifting theorem. This also uncovers the complete structure of the Beurling-type reducing and invariant subspaces of Hankel operators. Kernel spaces of Hankel operators play a key role in the analysis. # Day 2 (January 30 2025, Thursday) # Lecture 1 # Linear Independence of Hecke Operators and Modular Forms with Non-vanishing Central Values # Speaker: Priyanka Majumder # Abstract: In 2000, VanderKam proved that for sufficiently large primes \\(p\\), the Hecke operators are linearly independent in their actions on the cycle \\(\\mathbf{e}\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(\\infty\\) in the space of weight \\(2\\) cuspidal modular symbols for \\(\\Gamma_0(p)\\). I will talk about the generalization of VanderKam\u0026rsquo;s result to modular symbols of higher weights. This is a joint work with D. Banerjee. # Lecture 2 # A Minimal Completion Theorem and Almost Everywhere Equivalence for Completely Positive Maps # Speaker: Arghya Chongdar # Abstract: The problem of completing partially specified matrices to positive matrices has been extensively studied due to its theoretical significance and practical applications. In this talk, we address an analogous problem: completing a linear map on \\(C^\\ast\\)-algebras to a completely positive map. It is shown that whenever such a completion is feasible there exists a unique minimal completion. This theorem is used to show that under some very general conditions a completely positive map almost everywhere equivalent to a quasi-pure map is actually equal to that map. This talk is based on a joint work with my advisor Prof. B. V. R Bhat. # Lecture 3 # Complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces and de Branges-Rovnyak spaces # Speaker: Samir Panja # Abstract: In this talk, we will consider de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of a considerably large class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and find a characterization for them to be complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces. # We will show that a non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak space, associated to a contractive multiplier, of the Hardy space over the bidisc or the Bergman space over the unit disc is a complete Nevanlinna-Pick space if and only if it is isometrically isomorphic to the Hardy space over the unit disc as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. On the contrary, it will be shown that non-trivial de Branges-Rovnyak spaces of the Hardy space over the \\(n\\)-disc with \\(n\\geq 3\\) are never complete Nevanlinna-Pick spaces. The talk will be based on joint work with H. Ahmed, B.K. Das.\nLecture 4 # Spectral radii for subsets of Hilbert \\(C^\\ast\\)-modules # Speaker: Biswarup Saha # Abstract: The notions of joint and outer spectral radii are extended to the setting of Hilbert \\(C^\\ast\\)-bimodules. A Rota-Strang type characterisation is proved for the joint spectral radius. In this general setting, an approximation result for the joint spectral radius in terms of the outer spectral radius has been established. This work leads to a new proof of the Wielandt-Friedland\u0026rsquo;s formula for the spectral radius of positive maps. It is observed that algebras generated by tuples of matrices can be determined and their dimensions can be computed by realizing them as linear span of Choi-Kraus coefficients of some easily computable completely positive maps. This talk is based on a joint work with B V Rajarama Bhat and Prajakta Sahasrabuddhe. # Lecture 5 # Estimation of Spectral Risk Measures for Left Truncated and Right Censored Data # Speaker: Suparna Biswas # Abstract: I will discuss a broader category of risk measures referred to as spectral risk measures, along with their estimation in the context of left truncated and right censored (LTRC) data. LTRC are encountered frequently in insurance loss data due to deductibles and policy limits. Risk estimation is an important task in insurance as it is a necessary step for determining premiums under various policy terms. Spectral risk measures are inherently coherent and have the benefit of connecting the risk measure to the user\u0026rsquo;s risk aversion. We propose a nonparametric estimator of spectral risk measure using the product limit estimator and establish the asymptotic normality for our proposed estimator. We also develop an Edgeworth expansion of our proposed estimator. The bootstrap is employed to approximate the distribution of our proposed estimator and is shown to be second-order accurate. Monte Carlo studies are conducted to compare the proposed spectral risk measure estimator with the existing parametric and nonparametric estimators for left-truncated and right-censored data. Based on our simulation study we estimate the exponential spectral risk measure for two data sets viz; Norwegian fire claims and French marine losses. # Lecture 6 # Expected length of random polynomial lemniscates # Speaker: Subhajit Ghosh # Abstract: A lemniscate of a monic complex polynomial \\( Q_n \\) is the sublevel set \\( \\{z \\in \\mathbb{C} \\mid |Q_n(z)| \u003c t\\} \\) for some \\( t \u003e 0 \\). Erdős, Herzog, and Piranian initiated the study of lemniscates, focusing on geometric and topological properties such as area, length, and the number of connected components of unit lemniscates (\\( t = 1 \\)) in their 1958 paper [1]. While the maximal length of a lemniscate for a degree-\\( n \\) polynomial is known to be of the order \\( n \\), this talk explores the typical length of random polynomial lemniscates. Using an integral geometric formula, we show that for polynomials with i.i.d. roots uniformly distributed in \\( \\mathbb{D} \\), the expected length of their lemniscates is bounded above by \\( O(\\log n) \\), significantly less than the optimal order. # Reference: [1] P. Erdős, F. Herzog, and G. Piranian, Metric properties of polynomials, J. Analyse Math., 6 (1958), pp. 125–148.a # Day 3 (January 31 2025, Friday) # Lecture 1 # Some invariants for continuous piecewise monotone maps # Speaker: Chaitanya G K # Abstract: Continuous piecewise monotone maps on compact intervals provide simple examples of dynamical systems, however their behavior can be very complex. In fact, even the simplest of such maps, which is piecewise linear and has only one turning point, can be chaotic in the sense of both Devaney and Li-Yorke, such as the so-called tent map. In this talk we will look at certain invariants for such maps that can help us in classifying them up to topological conjugacy. # Lecture 2 # An elementary computational approach to the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition and the Jordan canonical form # Speaker: Renu Shekhawat # Abstract: Let \\(\\mathbb K\\) be a field, \\(A\\) be a matrix in \\(M_n(\\mathbb K)\\), and \\(\\mathbb L\\) be the splitting field of the characteristic polynomial of \\(A\\). In this talk, we will prove the existence and uniqueness of the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition of \\(A\\), viewed as a matrix in \\(M_n(\\mathbb L)\\), in an elementary computational way. The main strategy is the transformation of \\(A\\) to an appropriate block-diagonal form via similarity transformations obtained from Roth\u0026rsquo;s removal rule. Moreover, if \\(\\mathbb F\\) is the fixed field of \\(\\mathrm{Aut}(\\mathbb L/ \\mathbb K)\\) then the potentially-diagonalizable and nilpotent parts of \\(A\\) are both in \\(M_n(\\mathbb F)\\); in particular, when \\(\\mathbb K\\) is a perfect field, they are both in \\(M_n(\\mathbb K)\\). With the block-diagonal form of \\(A\\) in hand, by appropriately using Roth\u0026rsquo;s removal rule in the context of strictly upper-triangular matrices, we will arrive at the Jordan canonical form of \\(A\\). # Lecture 3 # Induced Isometric Representations # Speaker: Piyasa Sarkar # Abstract: Let \\(\\mathcal{H}\\) be a separable Hilbert space. A one-parameter \\(E_0\\)-semigroup \\(\\{\\alpha_t\\}_{t \\geq 0}\\) is a family of unital, normal, \\(*\\)-endomorphisms of \\(B(\\mathcal{H})\\) that obey the semigroup property, along with some continuity conditions. \\(E_0\\)-semigroups can be classified into three types depending upon the \u0026ldquo;abundance\u0026rdquo; of units and whether the said units generate the associated product system. One-parameter \\(E_0\\)-semigroups have been studied extensively by Powers, Arveson and other authors, and Arveson showed in his works that a one-parameter \\(E_0\\)-semigroup is a CCR flow if and only if it has units and is type I. He also introduced a numerical invariant, called the index, which provides an estimate about the number of units of an \\(E_0\\)-semigroup. # In this talk, I shall give a brief introduction to multi-parameter \\(E_0\\)-semigroups, focusing on CCR flows over closed convex cones in \\(\\mathbb{R}^d\\), briefly touching on the differences between the one- parameter and multi-parameter theory. I shall also define Induced Isometric Representations, where we \u0026ldquo;induce\u0026rdquo; isometric representations from discrete semigroups onto continuous ones, and explain how these help with achieving uncountably many examples of prime type I CCR flows with index \\(k\\), for any \\(k \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup \\{\\infty\\}\\).\nLecture 4 # Products of two orthogonal projections # Speaker: Jaydeep Bhattacharjee # Abstract: In this talk, we shall discuss the classification of bounded operators that are products of two orthogonal projections on a Hilbert space. Our results complement some of the classical results of Crimmins and von Neumann. We also characterize the products of two inner projections defined on the Hardy space over the unit polydisc. This talk is based on a joint work with Jaydeb Sarkar. # Lecture 5 # Invariant subspaces of contractions with constant characteristic function # Speaker: Sudip Ranjan Bhuia # Abstract: In this talk, we shall describe all the invariant subspaces of a completely nonunitary contraction \\(T_c\\) with nonzero scalar constant characteristic function \\(c\\), where \\(|c|\\lt 1 \\). Moreover, we show that \\(T_c\\) and the restriction to its invariant subspaces are essentially normal. Using this description of \\(T_c\\)-invariant subspaces, we then identify the hyperinvariant subspaces. # Lecture 6 # Operator Lipschitz Functions # Speaker: Prof. Vladimir Peller # Affiliation: Professor, St. Petersburg State University # Abstract: A function \\(f\\) on the real line is called an operator Lipschitz function if \\[\\|f(A)-f(B)\\| \\leq \\text{const}\\|A-B\\|\\] # for arbitrary self-adjoint operators \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Not all Lipschitz functions are operator Lipschitz. For example, the function \\(|x|\\) is not operator Lipschitz. The class of operator Lipschitz functions plays an important role in perturbation theory. I am going to give necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for a function to be operator Lipschitz. Similarly, one can define operator Lipschitz functions on the circle and on subsets of the complex plane.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/2025/","section":"ISI Bangalore PDF-RS Symposium 2026","summary":"","title":"ISI Bangalore PDF-RS Symposium 2025","type":"page"},{"content":" \u0026ensp; Platinum Jubilee Auditorium, ISIBC \u0026ensp; 02-03 March 2026 About # The PDF-RS Symposium is an annual academic event organised by the Research Scholars at the Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit (SMU) of the Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore.

Moreover, if domains \\(\\Omega_1\\) and \\(\\Omega_2\\) are related by a biholomorphic or a proper map, then the corresponding Bergman spaces are naturally connected, and their Bergman kernels satisfy a transformation identity determined by the map. # In contrast, for a general domain \\(\\Omega\\), there is no canonical definition of the Hardy space. In this talk, we describe a construction of a Hardy space for a certain class of domains and investigate the relationship between the corresponding kernels when \\(\\Omega_1\\) and \\(\\Omega_2\\) are related by a \\(2\\)-proper map. This talk is based on a joint work with Prof. Sameer Chavan and Santu Bera.\nLecture 2 # Solvability of Automorphism group of Commutative algebras and Isolated Hypersurface Singularities # Speaker: Dibyendu Das # Affiliation: Senior Research Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore. # Abstract: Let \\(A\\) be a finite-dimensional commutative associative algebra with unity over an algebraically closed field \\(K\\), and \\(\\text{Aut}_K(A)\\) denotes the group of all \\(K\\)-algebra automorphisms of \\(A\\). The aim of the talk is to discuss about the solvability of \\(\\text{Aut}_K(A)\\) and its connection with isolated hypersurface singularities. # Lecture 3 # Visibility domains in complex manifolds # Speaker: Rumpa Masanta # Affiliation: Postdoctoral Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore. # Abstract: In this talk, we extend the notion of visibility with respect to the Kobayashi distance to domains in arbitrary complex manifolds. Visibility here is a weak notion of negative curvature and refers to a property resembling visibility in the sense of Eberlein\u0026ndash;O\u0026rsquo;Neill for Riemannian manifolds. However, we do not assume Cauchy-completeness, with respect to the Kobayashi distance, of the domains in question. The visibility property of a domain \\(D\\) can be used to deduce many properties of certain holomorphic mappings into \\(D\\), ranging from their continuous extendibility to the iterative dynamics of such self-maps of \\(D\\). Here, we present a few sufficient conditions for visibility in the above setting, and with these conditions, we see that the class of domains with the visibility property is very large. Finally, we will discuss an application of visibility and establish a far-reaching generalisation of the classical Wolff\u0026ndash;Denjoy theorem. # Lecture 4 # Hyponormal contractions and analytic shifts # Speaker: Sneha B # Affiliation: Senior Research Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore. # Abstract: Hyponormal operators are known to be among the most difficult operators to analyze. In this work, we focus on two finite types of hyponormal operators. The first type becomes analytic shifts, while the second type admits analytic models. A basic model for hyponormal operators plays a key role in our analysis. This talk is based on joint work with Neeru Bala and Jaydeb Sarkar. # Lecture 5 # Invariant subspaces of Brownian shifts # Speaker: Soma Das # Affiliation: NBHM Postdoctoral Fellow. # Abstract: Brownian shifts were introduced by Agler and Stankus in the study of \\(m\\)-isometries, and they resolved the invariant subspace problem for these operators in the classical setting. In this talk, we will present classification results concerning the unitary equivalence of restrictions of Brownian shifts to their invariant subspaces in the classical case. Furthermore, we will extend the discussion to Brownian shifts acting on vector-valued Hardy spaces. In this broader framework, we obtain a characterization of invariant subspaces and provide a solution to the corresponding unitary equivalence problem for the invariant subspaces of these shifts. # This talk is mainly based on joint work with Nilanjan Das and Jaydeb Sarkar.\nDay 2 (March 03 2026, Tuesday) # Lecture 1 # Foguel-type operators similar to contractions # Speaker: Nilanjan Das # Affiliation: Postdoctoral Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore # Abstract: Pisier\u0026rsquo;s celebrated counterexample to Halmos\u0026rsquo;s similarity problem was based on \\(2 \\times 2\\) upper triangular block operator matrices involving three classical operators: forward and backward shifts on the diagonal and Hankel operators in the off-diagonal entry. Together with another classical object, namely Toeplitz operators, one can formulate another \\(2^3 -1 = 7\\) types of \\(2 \\times 2\\) upper triangular block operator matrices, which we refer to as Foguel-type operators. Our plan is to review some existing literature on the similarity problem and to describe some of our own results, characterizing when the aforementioned Foguel-type operators are similar to contractions. For the most part, this talk will be based on a joint work with Dr. Soma Das and Prof. Jaydeb Sarkar. # Lecture 2 # Instantaneous Everywhere Explosion of Interacting Diffusions # Speaker: Shubham Ovhal # Affiliation: Senior Research Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore. # Abstract: We consider a system of interacting SDEs on the integer lattice with multiplicative noise and a drift satisfying the finite Osgood\u0026rsquo;s condition. We show instantaneous everywhere blowup for initial profiles decaying slower than \\(\\exp ( -\\sqrt{\\big|\\log |x|\\big|})\\). We employ the splitting-up method to compare the interacting system to a one-dimensional SDE which blows up. # Lecture 3 # Words Play with Groups and Algebras # Speaker: Saikat Panja # Affiliation: Postdoctoral Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore # Abstract: A word here refers to an element of a finitely generated free group (respectively a free \\(k\\)-algebra; \\(k\\) is a field) on \\(r\\) letters. # Given a group \\(G\\) (resp. an algebra \\(A\\)) and a word, one gets a natural map \\(G^r\\longrightarrow G\\) (resp. \\(A^r\\longrightarrow A\\)) by substitution. These are known as word maps. This survey talk will present a selection of results on word maps for groups as well as algebras, obtained over the past several decades. I will also touch upon some collaborative contributions to the subject.\nLecture 4 # Closed Extensions of a Closed Operator # Speaker: Gahin Maiti # Affiliation: Senior Research Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore. # Abstract: The talk follows the paper by Christopher Fischbacher titled The Closed Extensions of a Closed Operator. # Given a densely defined and closed operator \\(A\\) acting on a complex Hilbert space \\(\\mathcal{H}\\), we establish a one-to-one correspondence between its closed extensions and subspaces \\(\\mathfrak{M}\\subset\\mathcal{D}(A^*)\\), that are closed with respect to the graph norm of \\(A^*\\) and satisfy certain conditions. In particular, this will allow us to characterize all densely defined and closed restrictions of \\(A^*\\). After this, we will express our results using the language of Gel\u0026rsquo;fand triples generalizing the well-known results for the selfadjoint case.\nAs applications we construct:\na sequence of densely defined operators that converge in the generalized sense to a non-densely defined operator, a non-closable extension of a symmetric operator and selfadjoint extensions of Laplacians with a generalized boundary condition. Lecture 5 # Matricial ranges, dilations, and unital contractive maps # Speaker: Pankaj Dey # Affiliation: Postdoctoral Fellow, SMU, ISI Bangalore # Abstract: Arveson introduced the notion of the matricial range of an operator in his remarkable article called Subalgebras of \\(C^*\\)-algebras II (Acta Math, 128, 1972) and established that every unital positive map on the operator system generated by the Jordan block of size \\(2\\) is completely positive. This describes the matricial range of the Jordan block of size \\(2\\) as the set of all matrices with numerical radius at most \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). This proof is far from trivial and depends on subtle results of Ando. After fifty years of the above result of Arveson, the matricial range of the Jordan block of size \\(n\\) has not been characterized for \\(n\\geq 3\\). In this talk, we will discuss recent progress on this long-standing open problem for \\(n=3\\), using dilation-theoretic techniques. This talk is based on joint work with Mithun Mukherjee and Atanu Dhang. # ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"ISI Bangalore PDF-RS Symposium 2026","summary":"","title":"ISI Bangalore PDF-RS Symposium 2026","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]
